                <p>I'm currently a student at Flatiron School; an intensive coding program that teaches modern technologies such as Javascript, React, HTML/CSS, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, SQL, JSON API , and Redux. Why did I decide to learn programming? Because I love to create, problem solve, and come up with solutions. I have a passion for technology and I'm eager to push the boundaries in what I know. It is my mission to develop projects that help and inspire people.</p>

                <p>I'm currently an undergrad student at Purdue Univeristy. Before taking the leap into development, I initially started a degree in Cybersecurity. I learned all about networking, the OSI model, servers, firewalls, ports, TCP/UDP, and how to keep data secure. These concepts carry over into programming, and now my degree focus is currently in Programming and Software Development. </p>

                    <p>My first job in tech was a short contract position at the National Rural Telecommunications Coop. Since I love helping others, I used my knowledge and training to assist rural communities with their networking and internet connectivity as a Tier 1 Tech Support Specialist. I learned how important it is to create simple, easy-to-follow designs for my projects that are user friendly. Technology works best with team oriented problem solving and good communication.</p>

                    <p>I have always had a passion for helping people. I worked in the hospital as a Patient Care Tech/Certified Nursing Assistant for just shy of two years before entering the tech field with my most recent position being at Bon Secours. I started my journey in healthcare just as the Covid pandemic hit in Janurary 2020. I worked hands on with patients in an Intensive Care Unit and Orthopedic Unit. I will always be deeply passionate about helping others when they are in need and I'm eager to bring that passion into my code and software.  </p>
